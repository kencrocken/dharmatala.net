I believe its been said before - the buddhism of Tibetans is not necessarily what is known as Tibetan Buddhism.  Our enlightenment rests in the path, not in those who teach it.  Tibetan history, Tibetan politics and Tibetan mores have no effect on my practice.

That being said, for the sects of Tibetan Buddhism, taking advantage of our laws and resources is a tradeoff.  It's not so much impropriety, it is the appearance of impropriety.  As long as the question of impropriety is open, there will be someone looking for the answer.  The finances should be in order and transparent - its a hassle, for sure, but then again this is samsara and the benefit of such would be great.

It is interesting that this topic of America and Tibetan Buddhism has come up, I recently watched Chogyam Trungpa's talk about Tibetan Buddhism and American Karma.  The crux of which, from what I can tell, is that its a lonely path.  Its a path for those of us in the States to take for ourselves.

For those who say that there is no Dharma in the West, I would ask them to look closer.  Often the choices seem to be Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, etc ... and our philosophical history is left out.  The Western philosophical tradition runs deep and much Dharma is to be found.  Though the task is difficult and, as Trungpa Rinpoche stated, it is a lonely - it is a task for each of us interested in the Dharma.  Our path is here, not in a far away land. I have to deal with American history, American politics and American mores - these are things that affect my practice.
